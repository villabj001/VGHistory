   <tr>

     <td>1998</td>

     <td>GoldenEye 007</td>

     <td>GoldenEye was definitely one of the games alongside Doom and Quake to start off the FPS genre. It's probably the best licensed game ever and one of the best games on the N64. I think this game deserved it's spot as it revolutionized an entire genre.</td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

     <td>1999</td>

     <td>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</td>

     <td>Ocarina of Time was one of the games i've played on this list. This is what seperated Nintendo from it's competition. It's a first take at an Open World game unlike most 3D platformers of its time. This game really made people think of adventure and is still regarded as the best game of the series. I agree that this is Game of the Year</td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

     <td>2000</td>

     <td>The Sims</td>

     <td>The Sims is a life simulator. You create Sims which represent humans and can control their everyday life. This is the first of the spinoff Sims series which got bigger than it's original SimCity. I loved playing the titles later on so I have to thank this original game </td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

     <td>2001</td>

     <td>Gran Turismo 3</td>

     <td>Gran Turismo is a PlayStation exclusive racing game. Before this series, there were only racing games in arcades. This is one of the first realistic racing games on consoles. </td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

     <td>2002</td>

     <td>Halo: Combat Evolved</td>

     <td>The first of it's series, Halo: Combat Evolved was a launch title for the original Xbox. It is First Person Shooter game like GoldenEye but unlike GoldenEye, it is a team based FPS. This influences many online multiplayer FPS.</td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

     <td>2003</td>

     <td>Call of Duty</td>

     <td>The first major Cross-platform game to release. It does not have cross-platform multiplayer but the communities were huge. It's based more on realistic warfare unlike Halo.</td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

     <td>2004</td>

     <td>Half-Life 2</td>

     <td>Valve's best game is Half-Life 2. You play as a scientist who is working to save the Earth from an alien empire. This game has a lot of puzzles and has very good storytelling. There is no wonder that it is the  game of the year.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2005</td>

     <td>God of War</td>

     <td>God of War is a game based on Greek Mythology. It is about Kratos who is tasked to kill the God of War Ares. This game has very well-made fighting aspects and the story is top tier. The more you play the more you enjoy the writing over the game itself.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2006</td>

     <td>Gears of War</td>

     <td>Gears of War is a third person shooter. You work with your friends to get elimiate enemy forces off your planet. It is very enjoyable because you have to depend on your team more than you would in games like Call Of Duty where its all based on who is the better player.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2007</td>

     <td>Super Mario Galaxy</td>

     <td>Super Mario Galaxy is Nintendo's first 3D Mario on the Wii. Instead of the usual 3D platformer tropes of a big level and you just going around and collecting stuff, SMG had planets and gravity physics which added to the generic Mario formula and made it all the more fun. Mario games in general are super fun but with each of them having it's own quirk, Galaxy really shines.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2008</td>

     <td>Little Big Planet</td>

     <td>LittleBigPlanet is a 2D sidescrolling platformer. What seperates it from the hundreds of its kind is the creative aspects. You can create your own levels for you to play but you could even upload it online for others to play. With this you can play levels from across the world and it created it's own community which is still active to this day with the latest game allowing support for all game levels.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2009</td>

     <td>Batman: Arkham Asylum</td>

     <td>Licensed superhero games are always a shot in the dark. The most notable worst game was SuperMan 64. But Batman: Arkham Asylum is not like that. This game takes the storytelling of the DC comics and puts it perfectly into games. This game includes a lot of exploring and quicktime events which are a staple in many adventure games now.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2010</td>

     <td>Mass Effect 2</td>

     <td>Mass Effect's story carries the entire game. It has a huge universe with aliens, technology and insane fights. The dialogue cutscenes are some of the best in gaming history and the gameplay compliments it. This game definitely left a mark in the hearts of people which cannot be forgotten.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2011</td>

     <td>Portal 2</td>

     <td>Valve shows off that they cannot make a 3rd game with Portal. Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games of the decade and deserves all the recognition. The sarcastic jokes from the villainous robots and the lore behind the overall facility really makes this game enjoyable. But even with how good this game is, there will never be a 3rd.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2012</td>

     <td>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</td>

     <td>Skyrims is probably the most modded game in existence. While the base game itself is an amazing experience, Skyrim was probably the first widely modded game with a huge modding community. The mods are what made the game so popular and is a reason why it was game of the year.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2013</td>

     <td>Grand Theft Auto V</td>

     <td>Grand Theft Auto V is the latest entry in the series. While the other games are amazing themselves, this is the best one. The amount of content in this game is insane due to the online multiplayer. This game has everything that made previous games good. Amazing story, realistic visuals, good gameplay and a huge modding community. If I were looking at this without bias, this would be the best game on the list.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2014</td>

     <td>Hearthstone</td>

     <td>Hearthstone is one of the only popular card games online other than the countless amounts of Pokers. It is free to play which makes it easily accessible and as mentioned before one of its kind. This game is one of many that started the massive competitive scenes of current online games.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2015</td>

     <td>Fallout 4</td>

     <td>After being in cryosleep for years to survive a nuclear war, you wake up and experience apocalypse. This game's visuals are amazing and the way it's buildings imitate a 50s style is very aesthetically pleasing. This game fully represents Boston in the 50s... If it experienced a nuclear explosion.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2016</td>

     <td>Overwatch</td>

     <td>Overwatch during this time was the biggest competitive game at it's peak. Competitive games have been on the low and are now booming. Games like these do not have many complaints other than game balancing. Looking at the game from an artistic perspective really shows how much care was put into each and every hero. This game shaped the standard for Esports</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2017</td>

     <td>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</td>

     <td>Breath of the Wild is the Nintendo Switch's launch title. It competes with Ocarina of Time as the best Zelda game due to it's beatiful graphics, storytelling and open world exploration. This game has insane replayability and has so many things to do. You won't get bored playing this game and it's open world allows for calming exploration while also allowing you to combat against the Calamity.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2018</td>

     <td>Marvel's Spider-Man</td>

     <td>Another superhero game is Marvel's Spider-Man. This game has the best webslinging ever seen in a game. Unlike older games, it is very fluid and not quick and choppy. The story itself is like you took highlights of a comic and just pasted it into a game. This game got a lot of people buying a PS4 just to play it.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2019</td>

     <td>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</td>

     <td>The 5th game in the series is Smash ultimate. This series is known for its crossover and the hype of wondering who will be in the game. Until a few months ago, this game would always be the hot topic as the new DLC characters got everyone excited.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2020</td>

     <td>Animal Crossing New Horizons</td>

     <td>This game was huge during the first quarantine. This game is all about creating what you want and is super calming. Helped a lot of people during the rough times of covid.</td>
